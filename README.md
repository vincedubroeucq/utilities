# Utilities

Simple CSS Utility classes, based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) defaults, generated by Sass.

## Basic usage

Simply clone the repo or download the zip, and add the Sass files to your Sass folder.

Generate the utilities using the standard Sass commands. See [https://sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/) for information about Sass.

```
sass --watch {sass_source_folder}/utilities.scss:{css_destination_folder}/utilities.css
```

Then include the generated CSS file in your HTML.

Alternatively you can `@import` the `utilities.scss` file into your existing Sass pipeline.

Lastly, a pregenerated `utilities.css` file is provided to help you quickstart a project or just experiment !

Have fun !
